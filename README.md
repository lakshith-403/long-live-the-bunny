 Eco-system simulation

Set of insects with neural neworks for each has been simulated for number of generations using a genetic algorithm. Initially each insect moves randomly. Fitness has been measured proportional to the amount of light reached. (There is a light source on a specific coordinate). New generations of insects are trained by the experience of most suitable ancesstor insects. Goal is to let insects train themselves to reach the exact coordinate of the light source in the shortest path.

>Statuse: FAILED

>Result: Almost every insect went on a striaght path

>Observed Reason: Randomized nature of the initially generated neural networks are not enough
